Enlist starting in early 2011 as the feature HackFest 
project at the OpenCF Summit 2011 conference in Dallas, 
TX. The OCFS HackFest aimed to build a functional application 
that could be leveraged by non-profit organizations to 
better manage and track everything to do with volunteers. 
The idea came forth after Peter Farrell volunteered for a Team 
Ortho event and noticed that all volunteer hours were being 
tracked on spreadsheets. These spreadsheets were used to 
generate volunteer reward "bones" (points) in which volunteers 
could use to enter Team Ortho race events or purchase running gear.

Team Ortho's mission is to improve and enhance the lives 
of orthopaedic patients through our commitment to supporting 
research, education, and advancements in orthopaedic 
technology; and to promote good muscular, skeletal, and 
joint health by encouraging an active lifestyle including 
training for and participating in amateur athletic events.

Team Enlist would like to send a special thanks to the 
following individuals that helped us produce Enlist by 
providing feedback, testing nightly / release candidate 
builds, test cases / application or finding defects 
(in no particular order):
