Created version: 1.1.1
Updated version: 1.8.1

Notes:
- Compatible only with Adobe ColdFusion MX 7+, NewAtlanta BlueDragon 7+
	and Open BlueDragaon 1+.
- Call loadFramework in your onApplicationStart() event.
- Call handleRequest in your onRequestStart() or onRequest() events.

N.B.
Do not implement the handleRequest() in onRequest() application event if you
want to utilitze any CFCs that implement AJAX requests, web services, Flash
Remoting or event gateway requests.

ColdFusion MX will not execute these types of requests if you implement
the handleRequest() method in the onRequest() application event.

Certain methods are not available for use until after loadFramework() has
completed execution.  This is because the following method require the
framework to be loaded as they interact with framework components:

* setProperty()
* getProperty()
* isPropertyDefined()
* getAppManager()
* shouldReloadConfig()
